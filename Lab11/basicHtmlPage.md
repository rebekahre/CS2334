# The shorest introduction to HTML

## The simplest web page we can create
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Heading </h1>
<p>Paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

We can see that this page has one heading, and it has one paragraph, both located within the body of the page.
You can save it to your computer, name it `page.html`, and point your browser to it.

We will create similar pages, that are a bit more complex. You can create a few pages "by hand", but we will create thousands. Using our Java program will come handy.

You can read more about `HTML` at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp. There are many other sources as well, but you don't have to read more for now.
